        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>The Althea Diagnostic Simulator is a web application designed to demonstrate the principles of a rule-based expert system. It was built using foundational web technologies: <strong>HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript</strong>, proving that powerful interactive experiences can be created without complex frameworks.</p>
        <p>The core logic mimics early AI systems by mapping user-selected symptoms to a knowledge base of potential conditions. A symptom match score is calculated based on the percentage of matching symptoms, offering users a simplified yet insightful look into how automated diagnostic tools can function.</p>

        <h2>What was DENDRAL?</h2>
        <p>DENDRAL was a groundbreaking project in artificial intelligence from the 1960s. Considered one of the first "expert systems," its primary goal was to assist chemists in identifying unknown organic molecules. It worked by analyzing mass spectrometry data and using a set of rules derived from expert chemical knowledge to propose possible molecular structures. Its success proved that AI could be a powerful tool in specialized scientific domains.</p>
    
        <h2>What was MYCIN?</h2>
        <p>MYCIN, developed in the 1970s at Stanford University, was an expert system designed to diagnose infectious blood diseases and recommend antibiotic treatments. It operated through a series of "if-then" rules, engaging in a dialogue with a physician to gather information about a patient's symptoms and lab results. MYCIN was notable for its ability to reason with uncertainty, assigning "certainty factors" to its diagnoses, which made it one of the most famous and influential early AI systems.</p>
